### Day 1: January 6, Friday

[//]: # (This is also a comment.)

**Today's Progress**: Joined codingame to try and get better at solving difficult puzzle type problems and improve algorithm aproach to different situations , took out a relatively difficult challenge https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/there-is-no-spoon-episode-1  , took me 4hours , learned 2D arrays .

**Thoughts:** Struggled with multi-dimensional arrays implementing to the specific challenge at hand but eventually got there :)

### Day 2: January 7th, Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: Done the Ceaser cipher FCC challenge, made a [pen](http://codepen.io/skhamoud/full/ZLGwbe) out of it.

**Thoughts** : One of'em days, I just couldn't find my head, Challenge took ALOT of time :( . Trying to implement functional programming concepts everywhere might be the reason.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
